    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>For the past semester, I have deployed <a href="go.addcnin.blue/about">a custom shortlinker service</a> and my <a href="addcnin.blue">personal website</a> on a <a href="cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Compute Free Instance</a>. The custom shortlinker is a rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/links">CS61A Shortlinker</a> in Elixir, which was a good way for me to learn the new language. Upon deploying the Elixir version, however, I noticed that CPU usage hovered around a constant 100%, even the system was idling. I left it alone for a while, noting that it was responding to requests fairly quickly, leaving me to think that it was likely the BEAM that was idling.</p>

<h2 id="more-research">More Research</h2>
<p>Recently, I got back into Elixir, and curiosity (+ paying bills) prompted me to investigate into the issue more. I came across <a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/beam_cpu_usage/">this blog</a>, which answered all of my problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… enabling busy waiting causes the CPU to be saturated above 95%. Disabling busy waiting causes CPU utilization to scale with the workload.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s insane! Could it be possible that the BEAM was running empty cycles to claim the CPU, hence stealing cycles from other processes? There was only one way to tell.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-change">My Own Change</h2>
<p>I decided to make the changes the blog specified by adding these following lines to the BEAM arguments:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>+sbwt none
+sbwtdcpu none
+sbwtdio none
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the blog, they used Distillery, but I use default Mix releases, so I will document the changes below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Documentation:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html">Mix Release VM Documentation</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/addcninblue/links/commit/ddb45106492892c13834aeee20a83f47591bbf24#diff-f59a5941af2fadce5fbf5b04589acd10R12">Change Commit</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the required VM configuration files: <code class="highlighter-rouge">mix release.init</code>.</li>
  <li>Modify the VM configuration file by adding
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> +sbwt none
 +sbwtdcpu none
 +sbwtdio none
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>to <code class="highlighter-rouge">rel/vm.args.eex</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Recompile and deploy!</li>
</ol>

<p>And with that, I noticed that there was a dramatic reduction in compute:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/beam-reduced-usage.png" alt="Beam Reduced Usage" /></p>

<p>Note that CPU usage is <em>nearly zero</em>, where as before it was ~100%! This frees up the CPU cycles for redeployments to this server and for more concurrent apps running (Build times are cut by <strong>more than a half!</strong>). I will be monitoring this new deployment for any regressions, but it appears to be a very solid improvement.</p>
