    <p>I’ve taught for several semesters in Berkeley now, and I think it’s high time
I wrote some thoughts down before my knowledge on teaching fades
away.<sup id="fnref:teaching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:teaching" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> So here’s a collection of thoughts: we begin with a light
theory of how people acquire knowledge through inquiry, followed by a quick
meta-analysis of learning to learn, ending with teaching.</p>

<p>I like to view teaching as a way of approximating the learning processes that
people would normally undergo. The key difference is usually convenience and
speed; learning can be quite arduous, and teaching often eases the process.</p>

<p>But many educators forget what it’s like to be a student. They lean on
prescriptive methods of teaching, leading students to be walking reflection of
their image. Through this post, I hope that students and educators alike will
be able to rethink learning.</p>

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p>How do people learn? It all begins when a person asks “why?” and starts seeking
answers for themselves.<sup id="fnref:babies-why" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:babies-why" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s important to understand why this is successful. First, there’s the
question of motivation. When a person begins questioning the world, it’s their
internal motivation driving them to answer a question. This motivation allows
the individual to dig deeply into their question of choice, possibly uncovering
the truth they initially set out to find, possibly stumbling upon another
question. Regardless of the outcome, however, it’s imperative to note that the
individual’s motives do not stem from external factors. Rather, they’re internal,
allowing them to try, retry, and retry again should they run into a wall.</p>

<p>At the end of the journey to discovery, when all the why’s are answered, all
they’re left with is knowledge and satisfaction. It’s incredibly gratifying to be
able to ask a question, start with only a toolbox of inquisition, and to arrive
at some tangible knowledge.</p>

<p>Importantly, this process highlights a key component of learning: through the
grueling process of hunting down hints and clues that eventually yield the
answers, we implicitly learn about learning. We learn what to do, what not to
do, and how to go about answering similar questions in the future. In doing so,
we add new tools to our toolbox of inquisition.</p>

<h2 id="learning-to-learn">Learning to Learn</h2>

<p>Let’s examine this a bit more. If we want to be good teachers, it’s imperative
to understand the mechanism through which we obtain knowledge. Formalizing
the previous section on learning, we have a model that looks like the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Student has initial set of facts, as well as a toolbox of methods they
understand to experiment on the world.<sup id="fnref:consistency" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:consistency" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> They ask some motivated
question about the world around them.</li>
  <li>To answer this question, they initially have a broad (correct or incorrect)
hypothesis of how the world should behave according to their set of facts.</li>
  <li>They then conduct experiments to verify or challenge their beliefs.</li>
  <li>Eventually, they will obtain a new set of facts that updates their
understanding of the world. In the process, they might also obtain a new
method of experimentation to add to their toolbox.</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 1, with the extra knowledge and tools from step 4.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example-discovering-probability">Example: “Discovering Probability”</h3>

<p>Let’s use this framework to imagine what it might be like to rediscover the
memoryless property of coin flips.</p>

<p>A reasonable (even if wrong) initial set of beliefs about the world might be
something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beliefs:
    <ul>
      <li>Coins have some fixed chance of landing Heads or Tails. This chance does
  not change between flips.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Toolbox:
    <ul>
      <li>We can flip coins to test the chance of outcomes. (<em>physical</em>)</li>
      <li>If we believe strongly that the chance of flipping Heads is fixed, we can
  also simulate this. (<em>computational</em>)</li>
      <li>Similarly, if we believe strongly that the chance of flipping Heads is
  fixed, we can mathematically prove this. (<em>proof</em>) [^proof]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Initial hypothesis (belief that we want to test):
    <ul>
      <li>Coins are fair, so if we get many Heads in a row, it should start giving
  us Tails.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming that we only have the <em>physical</em> method available, we can easily test
the memoryless property of coin flips. If our initial hypothesis is true, then
we should expect to see more Heads than Tails after a Tail. However, recording
large number of flips will show us that this isn’t true.</p>

<p>As a result, we can update our internal beliefs about coin flips.</p>

<p>A couple of remarks are in order.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s interesting to note that if one holds the belief of coins being
consistent through flips, the memoryless property falls out immediately.
(Formally, conditional independence implies the memoryless property.)</li>
  <li>However, students will sometimes hold the simultaneous belief that coins are
(1) unchanging through rolls, and yet (2) believe in some kind of “mean
reversion,” or “bias toward the mean on subsequent rolls”. When confronted
with this discrepancy, they’ll often doubt (1) rather than (2), making the
<em>computational</em> and <em>proof</em>-based methods unavailable to them.</li>
  <li>Typically, as we go through this process of testing, we also run into
roadblocks and contradictions. These can be frustrating, but they’re
actually quite critical to learning! Since part of the process is
formulating a hypothesis, it’s important to understand the actual space of
viable hypotheses. Finding counterexamples allow us to understand the
boundaries of the hypothesis space, which in turn allow us to ask better,
more-informed questions.</li>
  <li>Also, as we go through this process, we often will come up with better ways
of doing things. (As the proverb goes, “necessity is the mother of
invention!”) These discoveries add to our toolbox, adding to step 1 and
accelerating step 3.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>With this model of learning in mind, we turn to teaching. Before we answer the
question of <em>how</em> we should teach, there’s a more fundamental question that
needs to be answered. Assuming a student is sufficiently self-motivated and
capable, why does teaching even exist? Why isn’t it always better for students
to ask questions, stumble around, and get a solid, fundamental grasp of
everything?</p>

<p>The answer is largely a question of efficiency. While it’s possible a student
can answer their own questions and discover new things about the world around
them, it simultaneously remains true that there are an infinite number of
“wrong paths” to go down.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-teaching">The Role of Teaching</h3>

<p>So how should we teach? In its purest form, teaching should approximate the
process outlined in <a href="#learning-to-learn">Learning to Learn</a>, with one important
modification: the teacher is given the role of guiding a student through making
<em>insightful</em> hypotheses and <em>insightful</em> wrong decisions.</p>

<p>In particular, this means teaching should never be prescriptive, where a method
is given without rationale and told to be adhered to. All too common, we see
this in public education. In calculus, for example, students are told to “just
differentiate, set to zero, and solve,” and to “check the second derivative
for validity.” According to our framework above, this method is wrong because
it <em>does not approximate learning</em>! Students cannot be given a result first and
then a hypothesis after, since it’s mentally unclear where this result is
supposed to fit into their framework of reality.</p>

<p>To fix this, we should rethink teaching by starting from a foundational
motivation. In the Calculus example above, instead of starting from a result,
form a motivating question first: “Suppose a ball were thrown in the air. How
do we calculate its highest point off the ground?” (This example can also be
helped with a graph of the ball at various points describing a parabola.) With
this motivating question, students can then form their own hypotheses and
understand where each possible solution falls short. In the end, it’s ideal for
the instructor to manually describe approaches that break, and then describe
the “valid solution” that students should come to.</p>

<h3 id="shortfalls-of-teaching">Shortfalls of Teaching</h3>

<p>As with any approximation, there are shortfalls. With teaching, it’s that the
process of error is sometimes completely removed since the process of
constructing bad paths has become artificial.</p>

<p>This is a necessary sacrifice we take in favor of accelerated learning, within
bounds. Many teachers forget the process of motivated learning and become
prescriptive (and they wonder why concepts don’t stick in students’ heads). As
educators, we can do a lot better: put yourself in your students’ shoes, rewind
your brains to match theirs, and relearn the concepts with them from a clean
slate.</p>

we don’t have much need to explicitly say this. <a href="#fnref:consistency" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">⤴</a></p>
