    <p>Anyone studying options for long enough begins to wonder about how the Greeks
interact. Like, sure, an option’s delta approaches 0 or 1 (depending on its
moneyness) as it gets closer to expiration, but what happens to its gamma, as
it gets closer to expiration? Does that depend on its delta? Natenburg goes a
bit into this with a plethora of graphs in his textbook. The unfortunate thing
about books is that they’re all 2D and noninteractive.</p>

<p>I decided to see what I could spin up with Julia and a bit of elbow grease. I
grabbed the latest option chain with <a href="https://developer.tdameritrade.com/option-chains/apis">TD
Ameritrade</a> and got to
work. (At the time of these graphs, SPY was trading near $419.) Behold, some
graphs:</p>

<p><strong>Gamma in response to Time and Delta:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Volatility in response to Time and Price (aka Vol Smile)</strong>
