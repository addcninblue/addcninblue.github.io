  <p>“The only constant in life is change.”</p>

  <p>- Heraclitus</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Keep the status quo, or accept change? This is a common problem we face on a -->
<!-- daily basis. Though taking action or choosing inaction often leads to -->
<!-- far-reaching ramifications, people often have deep-seated beliefs that aren't as -->
<!-- thought-out as they should be. Let's consider an example and see how it applies -->
<!-- to software engineering. -->

<p>There’s a pretty well-known article by Dan McKinley called <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring
Technology</a>. It describes
innovation tokens as a model of approximating an upper bound on new technologies
that a company can reasonably use.</p>

<p>I love this article. While it’s great at describing the technical side of
things, I also find the human side of things quite interesting. In this post,
I’ll talk about the human side of choosing alternates.</p>

<!-- I propose a framework to evaluate taking change -->
<!-- versus accepting the status quo, and we take a look at field of software -->
<!-- engineering. -->

<!-- ## Two Groups of People -->

<!-- There are largely two groups of opinionated people - those who _always_ want -->
<!-- change (small-l liberals), and those who _never_ want change (small-c -->
<!-- conservatives). -->

<h2 id="a-thought-experiment">A Thought Experiment</h2>

<p>Let’s consider an example. Suppose we own a boba shop, and we’re considering
switching from using regular cow milk in our drinks to using oat milk. I imagine
most readers fall into one of two camps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Of course! That sounds great for X, Y, and Z reasons.</li>
  <li>Why would you ever do that?</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, consider the opposite: for our boba shop, we’re considering switching
<em>from</em> using oat milk <em>to</em> using regular cow milk. I imagine that the
categorization above still applies.</p>

<p>What’s more, I often observe that those who fall into group 1 in the first
example aren’t always those who fall into group 2 in the second example, and
vice versa.<sup id="fnref:small" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:small" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> That is, some people <em>want change for the sake of change</em>,
and some people <em>hate change for change itself</em>.</p>

<p>Naively, we might believe that if choice A is better than choice B, then we
should always want choice A, regardless of where we start. It would mean,
therefore, that the people above are completely irrational. Are they?</p>

<h2 id="adding-friction-to-the-model">Adding Friction to the Model</h2>

<p>In a perfect world (frictionless surface, etc.), they <em>are</em> irrational. However,
let’s consider the effect of friction on decisionmaking. Suppose we add the
following constraint to the problem above:</p>

<blockquote class="proof">
  <p>When switching between milk choices, there is a fixed cost required to retrain
employees and source ingredients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we can easily see: if we make this fixed cost high enough, it might never
make sense for a company to switch choices. Conversely, if there is a <em>negative</em>
cost associated with switching (publicity, subsidy, etc.), then it might
<em>always</em> make sense to switch.</p>

<p>This extends beyond fixed costs. Friction can result from a number of factors,
including irrational ones. For example, extending the analogy above, it’s
possible for the boba shop to never wish to change due to the owners being
maximally risk-averse.</p>

<h2 id="software-engineering-and-corporate">Software Engineering and Corporate</h2>

<!-- In the corporate workplace, we often see a few tropes that lead to the situation -->
<!-- above, like: "Let's switch to Rust." Even though suggestions like these might be -->
<!-- better from the perspective of a single engineer, it might not be the best -->
<!-- choice for the organization as a whole. -->

<p>Back to <em>Choose Boring Technology</em>. The article assumes that companies are
perfectly rational and write from the perspective of choosing risk or not. But
what about the failure modes of companies to choose new technology?</p>

<p>In order for a company to choose a technology and benefit from it, the friction
incurred must be greater than the benefit of the old technology.</p>

<p>This technical friction comes in a few forms: education (needing to teach
everyone a new language along with all of its idioms), inexperience
(understanding the failure scenarios of the new tool), and external popularity
(does an ecosystem exist?).</p>

<p>Then there are also the pathological, irrational causes for friction:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Dislike for change, or group 2 from above</em></li>
  <li><em>Overstatement of risk</em></li>
  <li><em>Bad experiences from the past</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When choosing new technology, it’s worth considering them through the lens of
alternates. If the world in which the alternate was chosen is a better world,
yet the choice to switch is a poor one, consider the causes of friction. It
might be the case that there are tons of pathological causes for friction, in
which case the reasons not to switch are illegitimate, or it might be that the
benefit gained is far too small to offset the normal causes of friction.</p>
