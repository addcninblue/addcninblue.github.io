    <p>As a matter of existence, airport delays have always been relegated to the
domain of news. They were always in the camp of things that <em>existed</em> but
<em>happened to other people</em>. That is, I suppose, until it happened to me. After
spending a night at the airport, I’m now an Expert on Airports and thus more
than qualified to write my full thoughts on the Horror that is Airport Delays.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>On 10/15, I booked a flight from MDW to SJC on 12/24 to go home before flying
out to Taiwan. I had already resigned myself to the fate of brushing shoulders
against everyone else like a can of sardines, but I figured it would all be OK.
(This leg of my journey was mainly limited by the flight out to Taiwan, which
was difficult to schedule.)</p>

<p>A week out from the flight, we all saw the oncoming disaster called Winter Storm
Elliot. (As a side note, having grown up in sunny San Jose and having gone to
school at cloudy Berkeley, I suppose I’ve never lived through what half of
America calls a proper winter. Now I have.) Watching the weather forecasts, we
in the office couldn’t do much but hope for the best as the onslaught came. The
worst of the storm, I supposed, would be Thursday, when the storm hit its zenith
in Chicago. Indeed, that day was quite miserable – Friday was at least a bit
sunny and Saturday even bearable. On Saturday morning, I saw the sun and naively
thought the odds of a cancelled flight would be low. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<h2 id="a-slow-descent-into-madness">A Slow Descent (Into Madness)</h2>

<p>The red flags began. Oh boy did it go downhill. The first major red flag was
that my flight was already delayed from the start of the day. Interesting, I
thought. Doing some deeper digging (thanks @Flightaware!), I saw that the first
leg<sup id="fnref:legs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:legs" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of my plane’s route from Baltimore to Midway was cancelled. So it
became an open question in my head as to how they would go about finding a
replacement flight <em>and</em> replacement crew to staff the remainder of those
flights.</p>

<p>As the day progressed, the delay on my flight went from one hour to two, from
two hours to four, and peaked at six hours. As my boarding time neared, under
good advice<sup id="fnref:checking-in-after-departure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:checking-in-after-departure" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> from my parents, I left to the airport
before my flight’s original scheduled departure time. And there, I waited. And
waited. and waited …</p>

<p>At around 7:30 central time, about two hours after my flight was scheduled to
leave, I received a call from my dad: “Was your flight cancelled?” Checking
Southwest, he was totally right – I was sitting in a separate area from the
boarding area, so I missed announcements.</p>

<p>I packed my bags and spedwalk to the boarding area. On the way, I found a
separate flight to Oakland departing at 10:30, and figured I might as well ask
to join the waitlist there. As a result, I got in line for customer service for
that terminal.</p>

<p>I wasn’t that far back in line, but boy did people take forever. I became an
expert in estimation in that two grueling hours of waiting for some ~10 people
ahead of me (Godspeed to all the people behind me). I found that the time taken
at the customer service desk was largely a function of the number of people in a
party. It averaged 15 minutes per person, so a party of 4 took an hour. (They
really did!) I suppose there are hidden parallels between restaurant wait times
and airport support desks as a function of the number of people waiting! (I
would’ve thought that airport support time was a function of the number of
<em>parties</em> of people)</p>

<p>But I digress… In line, I booked two tickets in advance as insurance and then
some – one for 12/25 (the next day) and one for 12/26 (two days
later).<sup id="fnref:negative-externality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:negative-externality" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Some two and a half hours later, I made it to the
front of the line. Talking to the helpful people there, they said that the
Oakland flight was beyond booked. When I first got in line, there were maybe 6
people on the waitlist. It had since grown to 9+ and counting. My odds of making
it were beyond low. They transferred my flight to the next free one, on 12/25,
which happened to be exactly the same as one of the flights I booked (which I
cancelled shortly thereafter). At my request, they also placed me on the
waitlist for the first flight out the next morning at 9AM. And of course, the
voucher – they gave $200 travel credit to everyone who waited in line.</p>

<h2 id="the-brightest-night">The Brightest Night</h2>

<p>Night was me roaming around, sleepless. For my first hour of sleep, I tried to
sleep head to the side on a table. This really obnoxious tiktok kept playing in
the background – something about autodispensing popcorn in Midway and different
flavors. (I suppose the commercial worked; I still have nightmares about
popcorn.) After that first hour, I decided to pack my stuff and walk around.
Towards the front of section A’s food court, I found these tall comfy chairs,
and very luckily there was one left. I took it, put on sunglasses, and fell
asleep all the way until sunrise.</p>

<h2 id="the-fateful-day">The Fateful Day</h2>

<p>I woke up bright and early at 5AM, hungry to eat a bagel from Einstein Bros that
I had eyed the night before. (Waiting in line for Southwest support took until
past 10, which is when all the stores closed.) Boy was that bacon egg and cheese
the saddest bagel to have existed – the bacon was OK, but the cheese wasn’t
melted, and the egg tasted like foam. I downed my coffee and headed over to the
waiting area for the first flight of the day.</p>

<p>To keep things short, after two hours of waiting, I ended up getting on the
flight. That was perhaps the most grateful I’ve been in a while – I suppose it
really takes losing something to really appreciate having that thing back. The
thing that surprised me most was that the plane had around 15 seats missing,
which amounted to perhaps 10% of the seats. <em>How</em> was that possible?
Furthermore, I had checked the flight in the morning, and there were no empty
seats available! Either way, I landed in San Jose safe and soundly four hours
later.</p>

<h2 id="oh-so-what-happened-to-my-original-flight-had-i-not-taken-the-waitlisted-flight">Oh, so what happened to my original flight had I not taken the waitlisted flight?</h2>

<p>I went back and checked, and it turns out the flight was <em>cancelled yet again</em>.
This time, it seems for the same reasons! The originating flight didn’t make it
out of Virginia, causing the Midway to Oakland leg to get cancelled. Boy was
waiting in the airport the right decision.</p>

<h2 id="in-retrospect">In Retrospect</h2>

<p>So what <em>should</em> we make of the delays? Was it anyone’s fault? In retrospect,
it was a fairly unlucky set of circumstances. Weather caused flights to be
cancelled, which had cascading failures downstream. But I suppose that’s not the
full story – had the airlines cancelled the flights ahead of time instead of
cancelling them <em>after</em> everyone had already gone to the airport, maybe it
would’ve been a much better outcome for everyone involved. So, some
retrospectives:</p>

<h3 id="on-the-airline">On the Airline</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The line of communication between passengers and the airline broke down. This
was suboptimal for quite a few reasons:
    <ol>
      <li>Customers resorted to selfish actions (myself included): Once we lost the
guarantee of a safe flight home, it became a free-for-all, and people
overbooked flights. This undoubtedly impacted the system many times over
and helped no one. It’s basically the textbook definition of a negative
externality.</li>
      <li>Customers were left in purgatory. I didn’t hear about a rebooked flight;
there was no official communication about what to do next. Furthermore,
to think that the next direct flight (that I’m writing this on) <em>still
has 15 empty seats</em> – that’s just unacceptable.</li>
      <li>Related to point 1, but it likely made all the lines of support
overcrowded as well. It’s somewhat akin to the stampeding horde problem
or even the bank run problem, but once the situation <em>seems</em> even <em>a
little</em> out of control, it will quickly spiral to <em>very</em> out of control.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>There was no reason for the flights to be cancelled as late as they were. It
seemed that the reason for cancellation was due to a combination of
short-staffing and plane availability. I understand the want of optimism, but
in this case, it doesn’t seem like there existed a universe where the flight
actually took off. Cancelling them all ahead of time more optimistically
and committing to a plan of communication might have saved everyone lots of
pain.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="personal-takeaways">Personal Takeaways</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You’re really at the mercy of an airline to Do the Right Thing. When you
inevitably need to take an impacted flight, all you can do is show up on time
and pray for the best.</li>
  <li>It might be prudent to think ahead of time for backup plans: would you be OK
with spending the night at the airport? If so, it might be a good idea to
pack a pillow and blankets and mentally prepare yourself to spend the night.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="cheers-to-everyone-i-met-on-the-way">Cheers to everyone I met on the way</h2>

<p>Though this journey was quite painful, I must still give thanks to everyone that
I met on the way. To those whose flights to Rochester, NY, were cancelled, I
hope you either found a way back home to where you came from, or that you found
the next flight to Rochester. To a friend of a friend who I miraculously bumped
into while waiting for the first flight of day – I suppose it was only God’s
will that made us cross paths in the airport. I know I gained some of my sanity
back, even if I did think I was hallucinating for a moment.</p>

<p>And to Southwest snacks, thanks. (I’d just appreciate better communication next
time, but it seems like they improved on it for the second cancelled flight.)</p>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:legs" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>For the uninitiated, Southwest operates by scheduling their planes on multi-destination journeys, and tickets are sold for legs of that flight. My flight was the second leg of the day. <a href="#fnref:legs" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">⤴</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:checking-in-after-departure" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I heard stories last night of people checking in after their flight’s original departure time since they knew their flight would be delayed, but were turned away instead since they didn’t check in on time! <a href="#fnref:checking-in-after-departure" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">⤴</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:negative-externality" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I recognize that this is pretty bad in aggregate – one can imagine that, in the limit, if <em>everyone</em> in the same position as me did this, the airlines’ problems would be compounded <em>and then some</em>. I don’t have much to defend myself with except that I think there were much more elegant ways they could’ve solved this problem, and that this behavior is largely a function of last resort and fear rather than irrationality. <a href="#fnref:negative-externality" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">⤴</a></p>
