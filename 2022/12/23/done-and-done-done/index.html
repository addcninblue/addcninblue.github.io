    <p>At Optiver, our Automated Trading Systems team lead has a phrase that he likes
to say: “There’s ‘done’, and then there’s <em>‘done done’</em>.” What he means by that
is that projects often get to the point where <em>most</em> things are done in that it
works, but that last bit to push it over the edge into something self-sustaining
is recognizably an extra level of done. Through my first few months at Optiver,
I’ve found myself consistently struggling the most in this area - scoping out a
project and banging out some code isn’t difficult, but delivering it to the
point of a finished project takes forever. Now that I’m on a 3 week break from
work <sup id="fnref:vacation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vacation" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I figured it’s a good time to reflect.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-gap-between-done-and-done-done">Exploring the gap between Done and Done Done</h2>

<p>In school, the concept of Done Done doesn’t really exist. A project is either
Done or Not Done, and your professor is either Proud or Disappointed (something
like that, anyways). Why does this differ at a job?</p>

<p>I think a partial answer is due to relative value. In education, the relative
value of something pre-completion is close to zero, whereas at a job, the value
of something Done is quite high. I would estimate that the curve of usefulness
is somewhat logistic curve-shaped, with a strong bias towards the end of a
project. As you work on a project at a job, the usefulness of something grows
exponentially as you get near the Done line, and once you cross that line, the
growth of usefulness suddenly drops off - you’re not rewarded the same amount
per next unit of time you put into the project. Hence, something of a logistic
curve.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it’s perhaps not so hard to see why things don’t move from
Done to Done Done as quickly as they do from Not Existing to Done:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It feels like there’s much less marginal reward for moving things across the
finish line compared to making the thing exist in the first place.</li>
  <li>The thing is already somewhat usable.</li>
</ol>

<p>But perhaps there’s a bit more than this. In much of my experience, the gap
between Done and Done Done is the difference between hacking something up and
doing things the right way. For example, to show that a proof of concept works,
various things can be hard-coded to values that are expected. This obviously
doesn’t scale. It’s these shortcuts that have to be unwound and rewritten, which
often makes the gap between Done and Done Done that much wider.</p>

<p>I do think this example of “ironing out the hacks” is representative of the more
general problem, which is that the path to Done is often much clearer than the
path to Done Done. Perhaps this breakdown is fair:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Done” is the state where your core problem is solved.</li>
  <li>“Done Done” is the state where your ancillary problems are investigated and
  your core problem is hardened against the inconveniences of the real world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thinking back to the question of real life differing from college, the
“Done”ness of college projects doesn’t cut it at a company - the core business
problem is solved, sure, but the corners cut in a project don’t lend themselves
to maintainability.</p>
