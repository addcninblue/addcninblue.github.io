## Game Theory
- **Game Theory** encompasses a wide variety of games, but they all have a common factor: They all have situations of conflict or cooperation
- 2 or more parties will interact with each other

## Topics
- Impartial Combinatorial Games
- Zero-sum Games
- General sum games
    - Nash equilibria
    - Evoluationary games, ESs, correlated equilibria
- Mechanism Design

## A General-Sum Game
- (Taken from Ben Polak's class at Yale)
- Take a paper and write your name on it. Then, write either $$\alpha$$  or $$\beta$$.
- Here are the payoffs:
    - $$\alpha$$ and $$\alpha$$: Both get B-
    - $$\beta$$ and $$\beta$$: Both get B+
    - $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$: $$\alpha$$ gets A, $$\beta$$ gets C.
- There is a dominant strategy: **Picking $$\alpha$$**.

## Nimble
- Game rules:
    - Board with 8 spaces, numbered 1~8. There is 1 coin on the first space, 2 on the third, and 1 on the sixth.
    - Each turn, one coin can be moved any number of spaces to the left.
    - When a coin is moved off the board, it is removed from play.
    - Win condition: Last player to move a coin wins.
- Solution: This problem reduces to a Tweedledum & Tweedledee Strategy

## [Goobix Nim](https://www.goobix.com/games/nim/)
- Player first reduces to Tweedledum & Tweedledee
- Can computer first win?

## Impartial/Partial Games (??)
- Games that ahve the same options available to both players
- Examples: Chess, Checkers, etc.

## Combinatorial Games
- No randomness (Chess, Go, Tic-tac-toe)

## Payoff Diagram Syntax
- Payoff: (row, column)

| Row \ Column | $$\alpha$$ | $$\beta$$ |
| :-:          | :-:        | :-:       |
| $$\alpha$$   | (B-, B-)   | (A, C)    |
| $$\beta$$    | (C, A)     | (B+, B+)  |
