## Some More Notation
Let $$N_i$$ be the set of positions from which the next player can force a win in at most $$i$$ moves.

### Subtraction game
$$S=\{1,2,3\}$$. $$P_0 = \{0\} = P_1$$. $$N_1 = \{1,2,3\} = N_2$$.

$$N_{i+1} = \{x \in X \textrm{ s.t. } \exists \textrm{ a move from } x \textrm{ to } P_i\}$$ 

$$P_{i+1} = \{x \in X \textrm{ s.t. } \textrm{ all moves from } x \textrm{ are to } N_i\}$$ 

$$P_2 = \{0, 4\} = P_3$$ 

$$N_3 = \{1,2,3,5,6,7\} = N_4$$ 

This gives us the following:

$$P := \bigcup_{i \geq 0} P_i$$ 

$$N := \bigcup_{i \geq 0} N_i$$ 

and

$$X = P \cup N$$ 

###

Induction on $$B(x)$$: max number of moves to end of game from $$x$$.

Base case: $$B(X) = 0 \implies x \in P_0 \subseteq P$$

Inductive Hypothesis: $$\forall x \in X \textrm{ where } B(x) \leq n, x \in N_n \cup P_n$$. Let $$y$$ be such that $$B(y) \leq n + 1$$.

Proof: Every move from $$y$$ to $$z \in X$$ will have $$B(x) \leq n$$. There are two cases:
- $$y$$ goes to $$z \in N_n \implies y \in P_{n+1}$$ 
- $$y$$ goes to $$z \in P_n \implies y \in N_{n+1}$$ 

This shows that $$y \in P_{n+1} \cup N_{n+1}$$

Exercise: Show that $$x \in P \iff x \equiv 0, 2 \mod\ 7$$ 

### Chomp
Exercise: Try to beat computer at Chomp. It's hosted online by Ferguson.

General Strategies (poison at bottom left):
- $$n * n$$: Remove the upper right square. By convention, it's $$(2,2)$$.
- $$2 * n$$:

## Nim

## 1-Pile Nim
Trivial -- take all except 1.

## 2-Pile Nim
Take from larger pile to match other pile. This reduces to Tweedledum-Tweedledee.

## 3-Pile?
