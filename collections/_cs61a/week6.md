## Tips And Tricks For Working With Types
- The builtin function `type` gives you the type of an object:

    ```python
    >>> type(1)
    <class 'int'>
    ```
- The builtin function `isinstance` returns whether your object is of some type:
    ```python
    >>> isinstance(1, bool)
    False
    ```
