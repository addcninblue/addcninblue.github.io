    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>My old website was written in pure HTML and CSS back in high school, and the content was extremely outdated. Maintaining the website was a hassle and a nightmare, since there was a lack of cohesion in the code – it was very much glued together. I needed to be able to generate content for teaching quickly, and I knew the current solution I had then would not scale. As a result, I started to look for a solution involving something I knew well – Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll--whiteglass">Jekyll + Whiteglass</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eecs151/sp18/">CS151’s website</a>, which uses this same theme. Seeing that they converted a blog posting engine (Jekyll) into something more of a personal website generator from Markdown, I decided it was time to dive in and explore how it worked.</p>

<p>The setup of Jekyll + Whiteglass is extremely easy. Their instructions are straightforward and cohesive, and setup was quick. Converting the websites to a personal website took only a bit of time once I figured out the right pages to modify, and most of the pages I wrote are written in Markdown. Adding new pages is also extremely quick, and the syntax highlighting is beautiful, making it easy to generate new content.</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This website is served from a Google Cloud Engine instance with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">f1-micro</code> (free) plan, deployed using Dokku as a static website (behind Nginx).</p>
