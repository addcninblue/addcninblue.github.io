61A student? Go to my [teaching](/teaching/) section.

Recruiter? Here's my [resume](https://go.addcnin.blue/resume).

I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Statistics. I'm interested the broad areas of probability and statistics, computer security and distributed systems, and financial markets. In the past, I was a consultant in [Valley Consulting Group](https://vcg.berkeley.edu/), and I consulted for [Asana]() and [VSCO](). I am currently a Senior Mentor for 61A in [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) and an Undergraduate Student Instructor for [Berkeley's introductory computer science class](https://cs61a.org/).

Over Summer and Fall 2019, I interned at [Netskope](http://netskope.com/) on their Data/Infra team, scaling out their data pipelines. Read more about my experience [here](2019/12/23/netskope/).

Any questions? Feel free to shoot me an email at `addcninblue@institution.edu`
